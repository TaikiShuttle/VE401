# Term Project
### About this project
In this project, we will analyze the police shooting problem in US based on the data set provided by the Washington Post starting from the year 2015.
See https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings.
### What we analyze
We will analyze different aspects of the data including:
1. Does the occurence of police shooting follows a Poisson distribution?
2. Do the month and weekday affects the distribution of police shooting?
3. How the race can affect the police shooting data?
